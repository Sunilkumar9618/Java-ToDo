This project is a full-stack To-Do application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. It provides a seamless way to manage daily tasks with a clean, responsive interface and a robust backend powered by Java and Spring.

The backend is built with Spring Boot, exposing a RESTful API to handle task management. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), enabling users to add new tasks, update existing ones, delete tasks, and mark them as completed or pending. Data is persisted using a database integration, ensuring reliability and scalability.

On the frontend, React.js is used to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The application communicates with the backend through API calls (Axios/Fetch) and dynamically updates the UI based on user actions. The interface is designed to be responsive and intuitive, making task management efficient on both desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features:

Add, edit, delete, and view tasks easily

Mark tasks as completed or pending

REST API with Spring Boot for backend operations

Frontend powered by React.js with responsive design

API integration using Axios/Fetch for smooth communication

Persistent data storage with database support

Tech Stack:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, REST API

Database: MySQL / H2 (depending on setup)

Tools: Maven/Gradle, Axios/Fetch, GitHub

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills by integrating a modern Java backend with a JavaScript-based frontend. It is a great example of how Spring Boot and React can be combined to build scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications.
